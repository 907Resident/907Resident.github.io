Hello! My name is Moyo Ajayi, and I am an Env. Engineering PhD candidate at Vanderbilt University. I am graduating Spring 2021, and I am seeking a data intensive role starting Spring/Summer 2021. Please read on for more information about me.

I was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska, and throughout my childhood I was fortunate to be in proximity of nature. From waiting for moose to cross the street, checking the dumpster for bears, to gazing in wintry skies to see the brilliance of the northern lights, I truly believe that our natural world is beautiful. 

My parents guided me to pursue my curiosities through academics; therefore, I fused my interests with nature by selecting Environmental Biology (minor in Earth Science) as my undergraduate major. Through my undergraduate program, I was required to complete a senior thesis. I decided to complete my research above the Arctic circle near Toolik Lake, Alaska. With this project, my appetite for research grew rapidly, as I was able to one member on a multi-institutional team working with faculty, post-doctoral researchers, and graduate students. Most importantly, I developed a taste for coding. In my role, I was responsible for sampling the amount of CO2 assimilated by Arctic shrubs, and to be successful, I needed to parse specific portions of the dataset to perform the necessary analyses. I accomplished this by plunging into the MATLAB language, and my love for measuring greenhouse gases and employing computational techniques on the datasets germinated and has continued to grow.
